### What I learned

During this project, I gained experience with several key web development technologies and techniques:

Flexbox and Grid Layout:

Flexbox: I learned how to use Flexbox to manage layout in a flexible manner, which is especially useful for creating responsive designs. Flexbox allows for precise control over horizontal and vertical alignment, as well as dynamic adjustment of element sizes and positions based on available space.
Grid Layout: I explored CSS Grid Layout, which enables the creation of complex, grid-based designs. Grid provided me with the ability to manage columns and rows efficiently, facilitating the development of well-structured page layouts.
Positioning:

I gained experience with various CSS positioning techniques, including absolute, relative, fixed. This knowledge helped me to position elements accurately in relation to other elements and the viewport, enhancing layout control.
